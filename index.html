								<b>Leadership:</b>
								<br>I have developed and conducted orientation for international students at Victoria college
								at the University of Toronto. This includes ongoing event management, mentorship and
								general student support. In addition to this, I have spent a year with the Victoria university

								<b>Military Service:</b>
								<br>I have served full time national service with the Singapore Armed Forces for 2 years between 2016-2018.
								I have conducted over 60 unique combat missions as a transport operator.
								Collectively, I have transported over 30 tons of military cargo and infantry/artillery regiments across the country.
								This involves collaborative missions with US, Australia, Malaysia and Brunei militaries separately.
							</p>
							<p align="justify" style="text-align:justify">
								<b>Equity, Diversity & Inclusion:</b>
								<br>I believe inclusion in the lecture room and the research laboratory is critical for
								academic success. My time in the army has provided me with a well-rounded experience
								working with wonderful people from many different backgrounds.  Additionally, as an
								international mentor I have worked with students from different
								countries, religions, genders, sexual orientations and socioeconomic backgrounds.
								As an undergraduate student, I strive to create an environment in which anyone, from any
								background, feels valued as a member of the scientific community.
