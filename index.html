								<br>Image classification of Martian topographic features. Created an efficient
								scalable machine learning model in python using sklearn. The model was tested against
								independent Martian surface data and used supervised machine learning methods,
								thresholding and mask detection. The Martian surface data was provided by The
								National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) HiRISE instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Model training was done on a Linux server.
